; Set to 2 for low latency mode (single buffer).
; This option makes video butter smooth like on original emulated system.
; Adjusting is done by changing pixel clock. Not every display supports variable pixel clock.
; For proper adjusting and to reduce possible out of range pixel clock, use 60Hz HDMI video

; in clipping in bright parts of the image.

; The identifier part is case-insensitive, and the radius can be up to 64 units. 
; Identifier and radius are separated by a whitespace (' ') and/or a comma (',').

; - VIDPID as an eight digit hex number ("0x" can be omitted), then the radius (not hex).

; Permanently assign specific controller to specific player.
; Normally you don't need to use this option, but if you use arcade cabinet with integrated controllers then
; you may want to use it for specific player regardless which controller is used first.
; To assign it, you need to provide unique part of this controller ID.
; In USB debug log you may see list of input devices right after core has been loaded. 
; For example:
;
; opened 0( 0): /dev/input/event8 (1915:0040) 0 "7c:10:c9:15:22:33/df:47:3a:12:44:55" "Flydigi APEX2"

;
; following part is unique identifier in system ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
; So you need to provide part of this string identifying exactly this device. Don't include inputX part as it may change after reboot.
; Wireless devices usually have format MAC/MAC, wired devices use usb-... format.
; UPDATE: you may define up to 8 devices to the same player. Use player_1_controller in several lines to assign multiple devices to player 1.
;
; Example of such unique part of strings:
;
;player_1_controller=usb-1.2/  ;include / at the end so it won't match with something like usb-1.2.3

; When the core changes video mode, MiSTer will first look for a matching WIDTHxHEIGHT@VREFRESH section.
